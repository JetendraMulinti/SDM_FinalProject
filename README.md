# Disease Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project, titled "Disease Data Analysis and Visualization," focuses on harnessing the power of data to derive actionable insights in the healthcare sector. Our team aims to identify patterns and insights within disease data to improve decision-making processes in healthcare businesses. Using a robust PostgreSQL database system, ETL processes, and visual analytics through PowerBI, this project exemplifies the integration of data engineering and business intelligence to address real-world problems.

## Repository Structure

- `SQL/`: Contains all SQL scripts for creating and populating the operational and dimensional databases.
- `PowerBI/`: Stores the PowerBI dashboard files and related data visualization resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- SQL Server or a compatible SQL database system
- PowerBI Desktop for visualizations

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JetendraMulinti/SDM_FinalProject
   ```

2. Set up your SQL environment by running the SQL scripts located in the `SQL/` directory. This includes creating base tables and inserting data as specified.

3. Open and configure PowerBI files from the `PowerBI/` directory to connect to your database.


### Usage

To view and interact with the dashboard:
1. Open the PowerBI files in the `PowerBI/` directory with PowerBI Desktop.
2. Ensure that the data sources are correctly configured to fetch data from your SQL database.
3. Explore various analytics and visualizations already built into the dashboard.

## Features

- **Operational Database**: Utilizes SQL for robust data management and complex query support.
- **Dimensional Database and ETL Process**: Implements an OLAP schema for enhanced analytical processing and faster query performance.
- **Dashboard and Business Analytics**: Developed in PowerBI to provide interactive and real-time data visualizations.
- **Comparison of NoSQL vs. Relational Database Structures**: Analyzes the benefits and limitations of using NoSQL databases versus traditional relational database structures in the context of healthcare data.
- **AWS Architecture**: Leverages AWS for scalable cloud infrastructure, which supports the deployment and management of healthcare databases.
- **Snowflake Integration**: Uses Snowflake for its advanced features like scalability, concurrent access, and data sharing capabilities.

## Project Insights

The project demonstrates significant capabilities in analyzing healthcare data to discover disease trends, patient demographics, and treatment effectiveness. These insights can directly influence policy-making, patient care strategies, and overall business operations in healthcare institutions.
